# Classification and Representation

## Classification

To attempt classification, one method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and alll less than 0.5 as a 0. However, this method does not work well because classification is not actually a linear function.

The classification problem is just like the regression problem, except that the values y we now want to predict take on only a small number of discrete values. For nal we will focus on the binary classfication problem in which y can take on only two values, 0 and 1.
